Subjects (A/B):

A: Quick question about {company} hiring
B: {company} — would you explore outsource your {pain_area} to Mexico?
Body (HTML but reads like plain text):

Hi {first},

Noticed {trigger} at {company}. If you’re like most {segment}, the bottleneck isn’t ideas—it’s weekly execution on {pain_area}.

We run Mexico-based pods working US hours (managed service, not headcount). Typical use cases:

{use_case_1}
{use_case_2}
If I send a 3-line plan + price range, what’s the highest-priority role you’d hire in the next 30–60 days?
